# PROTOCOLS: THE FRICTION LOG

> **"The Truth is not hidden in the Order; it is hidden in the Noise."**

## 0. The Purpose
The **Friction Log** is a debugging tool for the soul.

In a healthy system, energy flows into action with minimal resistance (**Wú Wéi**). When energy meets resistance, it generates **Heat** (Friction).
* **Friction** manifests as: Irritation, boredom, circular thoughts, procrastination, dread, or "looping."
* **The Goal:** To capture these moments of heat to identify the underlying **Stagnant Loop** (The False Self pattern) causing the energy leak.

**Do not judge the friction. Just record it.**

## I. The Log Template

*Copy and paste this entry for each friction event.*

### 🔴 Friction Event #[001]
**Date/Time:** `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`
**Context:** *(What were you doing or trying to do?)*
>

**1. The Signal (Body/Sensation):**
*(Where is the heat? Tight chest, clenching jaw, heavy eyes, restless legs?)*
>

**2. The Narrative (The False Self Script):**
*(What is the loop saying? "I have to do this perfect," "They don't respect me," "I'll do it later.")*
>

**3. The Cost (Temporal Debt Assessment):**
*(If I accept this narrative, what is the debt? Loss of time? Damage to relationship? Loss of integrity?)*
>

**4. The Intervention (Innerstating Result):**
*(Did you run the Diagnostic Loop? What was the New Intention?)*
>

**5. The Outcome:**
*(Did you move? Or did you loop? Be honest.)*
>

## II. Weekly Audit: Pattern Recognition

At the end of the week, review your logs. Look for the **Code in the Noise.**

### 1. Identify the Loop
Do you see the same Narrative appearing multiple times?
* *Example:* If "I'm not ready yet" appears 5 times, you are in a **Perfectionism Loop**.
* *Example:* If "They are wrong" appears 5 times, you are in a **Control Loop**.

### 2. Measure the Debt
How much **Temporal Energy** did these loops consume this week?
* *Estimate:* (e.g., "I spent 4 hours looping on anxiety about the email.")

### 3. The Intermittent Great Effort
Select the **Single Loudest Loop** from this week.
* **The Action:** Schedule one specific **Intermittent Great Effort** to break it.
* *Example:* If the loop is "Avoiding the Dentist," the Action is "Call the Dentist."
* *Example:* If the loop is "Resentment at Work," the Action is "Have the difficult conversation."

## III. The Axiom of Repair

> **"You cannot fix a bug you haven't identified."**

Friction is not failure. Friction is data.
If you are logging it, you are observing it.
If you are observing it, you are not it.

**The Observer is Free.**
