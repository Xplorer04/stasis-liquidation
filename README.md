## 0. The Kernel
**Syntropy** is an open-source operating system for the human soul.

It is a toolkit designed to reverse the natural decay of entropy, generate **Obligate Novelty**, and maintain the **Aperture** of the True Self. It maps the physics of **Temporal Flow** to the ethics of **Service**, providing a framework to navigate a chaotic world without collapsing into Stagnant Order.

This repository does not contain answers. It contains **Protocols for Movement.**

## I. The Core Axioms (The Physics)

The system runs on the **Creation Theorem**. If you violate these laws, the system crashes (Burnout/Fragility).

1.  **The Law of Temporality:** No state is the "True State." Existence is **Perpetual Becoming**. To stop moving is to die.
2.  **Entropy vs. Syntropy:** The universe pushes toward disorder (Entropy). Life survives only by pulling toward higher complexity and order (Syntropy). You must be the engine of that pull.
3.  **Temporal Debt:** Avoidance is expensive. Every moment you delay a necessary action or truth, you incur debt. This debt accumulates as fragility. **Pay cash for your life.**
4.  **Aesthetic Coherence:** The value of an action is not in the outcome (which can be stolen), but in the **Intention** (which is unconsumable).

## II. Repository Structure

The codebase is organized into three modules: **Theory**, **Practice**, and **Tools**.
